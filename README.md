# MyEnergy Dashboard

A web dashboard for the **INFINITY 1000** portable power station (BLE name `YIchu…`, the device behind the *MyEnergy Power* Android app). The browser talks to the station directly over **Web Bluetooth**. It shows live power per rail, state of charge, temperature, switches and timers, lets you control the station, and estimates how long the battery will last.

## What's inside

```
packages/protocol   Dependency-free TS: frame builder, Modbus CRC, decoders, simulator, energy math (browser + Node)
apps/web            Next.js 15 · React 19 · Tailwind v4 · shadcn/ui · framer-motion · Zustand · Recharts · next-intl

```

- **Connect** (`/`): connect over Bluetooth, start the demo device, or watch a station that another browser is streaming. It detects whether the browser supports Web Bluetooth and explains what to do if it doesn't.
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`):
  - SOC ring with the runtime estimate (or time to full), next to the station's own estimate.
  - Animated energy-flow diagram; particle speed scales with watts.
  - AC/DC/USB cards with optimistic switches.
  - 10-minute sparkline and Wh counters for today and this session.
  - Controls sheet: charge limit, timers, light, backlight, modes.
  - Wi-Fi setup, connection details (GATT table, firmware), demo controls, and a raw frame console.
- **Planner** (`/planner`): what-if load planner with duty cycles, "how long can I run X", and the reverse "I need N hours → max load".
- **History** (`/history`): telemetry downsampled by the API, with energy totals. If the API is down it falls back to the current session's data.
- **Settings** (`/settings`): capacity and efficiencies, alert thresholds, custom service UUID, API sync, theme, language (English / فارسی with RTL and Persian digits), and °C/°F.

The web app works fully on its own with the demo device. The API is optional.

## Requirements

- Node ≥ 20.12 (developed on Node 22), pnpm 10 (`corepack enable`)
- For a real device: a browser with Web Bluetooth (see below)

## Run it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev            # web on http://localhost:3000, API on http://localhost:4000 (Swagger: /docs)
```

`pnpm dev` builds the protocol package first. On first run it also creates `apps/api/.env` from `.env.example` and the SQLite database (`apps/api/prisma/dev.db`).

To get sample history for the History page (48 h for the demo station):

```bash
pnpm --filter @myenergy/api build
pnpm --filter @myenergy/api seed:demo
```

Quality gates, all run from the root:

```bash
pnpm build          # protocol (tsup), api (nest), web (next)
pnpm test           # Vitest (protocol + web) and Jest (api unit + e2e on a throwaway SQLite DB)
pnpm lint
pnpm test:e2e       # Playwright smoke test (desktop + phone) against a production build; uses local Chrome
```

`test:e2e` uses the installed Google Chrome by default. Set `PW_CHANNEL=` (empty) and run `pnpm --filter @myenergy/web exec playwright install chromium` to use Playwright's own Chromium. `SCREENSHOTS=1 pnpm --filter @myenergy/web exec playwright test screenshots --project=desktop` regenerates `docs/screenshots` (start the API first so History has data).

Environment variables: `apps/web/.env.example` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`) and `apps/api/.env.example` (`DATABASE_URL`, `PORT`, `WEB_ORIGIN`, `TELEMETRY_STORE_BUCKET_S`).

## Install as an app (Windows / Android / ChromeOS)

The dashboard is a PWA. Once installed it opens from the Start menu or desktop in its own window, like any Chrome app.

```bash
pnpm app:build                 # production build into apps/web/.next-app
pnpm --filter @myenergy/api build
```

Start the app server (port **3210**) and the API (port 4000) in the background. This is safe to run repeatedly:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\start-myenergy.ps1
```

Then open `http://localhost:3210` in Chrome or Edge and click **Install app** in the header (or the install icon in the address bar).

The service worker caches every page and its JS on the first visit, so the installed app **opens and works even when the app server isn't running**. That covers Bluetooth, the demo station, the planner and settings. Only History, live watching and cloud sync need the API.

The installed app is a different origin (`localhost:3210`) from `pnpm dev` (`localhost:3000`). Its settings, and the Bluetooth device you pick, are therefore separate.

## Browser support for Web Bluetooth

| Platform | Works? |
| --- | --- |
| Chrome / Edge on Windows, macOS, ChromeOS | ✅ |
| Chrome on Android | ✅ (the best target: the UI is phone-first) |
| Chrome on Linux | ✅ (you may need `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`) |
| Safari (macOS / iOS), Firefox | ❌ No Web Bluetooth. On iPhone/iPad use the **Bluefy** browser |

The page must be served from **`https://` or `http://localhost`**, which Web Bluetooth requires. To use a phone during development, either:
- tunnel the dev server over HTTPS, or
- use Chrome's `chrome://inspect` port forwarding so the phone reaches it as `localhost`.

## Connecting a real device

1. Turn the station on and keep it within a few metres. Make sure no phone running the official app is connected to it, because BLE allows one central at a time.
2. Click **Connect via Bluetooth** and pick `YIchu…` in the chooser. If it isn't listed, use **Show all Bluetooth devices**.
3. The app then mirrors the original app's flow:
   - It discovers the primary services and uses the **first characteristic that has read + write + notify** for both writes and notifications.
   - It starts notifications.
   - It sends `YICHU|SN|?` at +100 ms, `YICHU|VER?` at +300 ms, `0C` at +500 ms and `0A` at +700 ms.
   - The station then streams `50` / `51` / `53` frames on its own.
4. If the link drops, it reconnects automatically (3 attempts, like the app's `maxContectSize = 3`).

### Finding your device's service UUID

Web Bluetooth only exposes services that the page lists in `optionalServices`. The original app hard-codes no UUID, so we pass a broad candidate list:
- `0xfff0`, `0xffe0`, `0xffe5`, `0xff00`, `0xff10`, `0xffd0`, `0xae00`, `0xfee7`
- `0x1800`, `0x1801`, `0x180a`, `0x180f`
- the Nordic UART service `6e400001-…`

If the station connects but **no service / characteristic appears** (Dashboard → *Details* shows "No services were accessible"):

1. Find the UUID, either way:
   - **Desktop Chrome/Edge:** open `chrome://bluetooth-internals/#devices` → **Start scan** → **Inspect** next to `YIchu…`. This page lists *all* services.
   - **Phone:** install **nRF Connect**, scan, and connect to `YIchu…`.
2. Note the UUID of the service whose characteristic has **Read, Write and Notify**.
3. Paste it into **Settings → Connection → Custom service UUIDs**. Formats: `fff0` or a full 128-bit UUID; separate several with commas.
4. Reconnect. In **Details** you can also pin a different characteristic manually; the choice is remembered.

When this happens the connect screen lists the services Chrome did expose and walks you through these steps. With Chrome's *Experimental Web Platform features* flag enabled, the app also listens to the station's advertisement for a few seconds. Any service UUIDs it hears are saved to Settings automatically; press **Try again** and pick the station once more.

## Protocol notes (from the reverse-engineered app)

Everything runs over one characteristic. The protocol is implemented in [`packages/protocol`](packages/protocol/src).

- **ASCII layer**: replies start with `YI`:
  - `YICHU|SN|?\r\n` → `YICHU|SN|<gatewaySn>|<deviceSn>|<dept>|<model>`
  - `YICHU|VER?` → `YICHU|VER|<sw>|<hdMain>|<hdDc>|<hdAc>|<hdBms>`
  - Wi-Fi provisioning: `YICHU|WIFI|<ssid>|<pass>\r\n`, then `YICHU|WIFI_RESET` at +500 ms, then Wi-Fi switch off at +1500 ms and on at +1800 ms
  - `YICHU|WIFI_CTL|CLEAN` clears the Wi-Fi config
- **Binary requests**: `4D4D 0010 <cmd> <len u16 BE> <payload> <CRC-16/Modbus, low byte first>`.
  - `0C` versions + serial
  - `0A` dept/model
  - `60` switches A0–A6
  - `61` timers A0–A4
  - `62` charge limit
  - `63` light (A0) / backlight (A1)
- **Binary responses**: `574C xxxx <cmd> <len> <payload> <crc>`.
  - `50` is the switch bitmap.
  - `51` holds the power / timer / light / charge-limit blocks.
  - `53` is the battery frame: SOC, sensor count at byte 29, then i16 × 0.1 °C.
  - `60`/`61`/`63` are acks (`00` = OK).
  - Long frames that arrive split across notifications are reassembled using the length field.

Details from the bundle that the original brief didn't capture:
- The `51` block length byte is a **byte count** (the app reads `2 × len` hex characters), not a word count.
- The **screen-off timer (`61 A1`) is in seconds** (the app's picker multiplies by 60). The other timers are in minutes.
- `0` means "never" for all timers.
- The app offers light modes off/low/high/SOS (0/20/40/60).
- The app's default max charge power is 350 W; `MGI106MG2HEU` maps to 1200 W.

**Out of scope:** OTA firmware updates (`YC-OTA-START` … `YC-OTA-RES`) are deliberately not implemented. A failed flash could brick the station, and the firmware files come from the vendor's cloud.

## Confirmed on a real device

Tested with a real **MGI032GR1HEU** (BLE name `YIchu:<wifi-mac>`, firmware 0.3.0 / inverter 1.7.0) over Chrome on Windows:

- Connect flow, ASCII `SN`/`VER` replies, `0C`/`0A`, and the streamed `50`/`51`/`53` frames all decode correctly. The device sends all three about once a second.
- **Response CRC** is CRC-16/Modbus over every preceding byte, low byte first. The response header bytes 2–3 are `00 10`, the same as in requests.
- **Extra `53` fields** that the original app ignores:
  - byte 1: state of health (100);
  - bytes 6–9: i32 BE current × 0.01 A (−2.18 A while delivering ~70 W AC);
  - a trailing `<count><u16 mV>` block: one cell voltage of 3.314 V, which looks like LFP.

  No capacity field is sent.
- **`51` block `ac`** holds temperatures ×0.1 °C: `[27.4, 31.8, 46.6, 46.6, 34.5]`. Word 0 equals the battery temperature; the others are probably inverter/MOSFET sensors.
- **`remainUsableTime` is always 0** on this firmware, so the station's own runtime estimate is hidden.
- **An undocumented `52` frame** (36 bytes, almost all zero) is also streamed and is shown as a generic frame.
- **A lost header was seen once:** a `51` frame arrived without its leading `57 4C`. The assembler restores it, but only if the repaired frame's CRC is valid.
- **Capacity.** At ~69 W AC, one full 1 % SOC step (84 → 83 %) took 8.8 min and ~10.1 Wh at the outlet. That means a ~1 kWh pack, so `MGI032*` now defaults to 1024 Wh.
- **The BMS SOC already excludes the reserve**, so the usable-capacity factor now defaults to 1.0. Saved settings that still had the old 0.9 are migrated.

## Still unverified

- The meaning of the `00 10` header bytes.
- `MGI106*` capacity and charge limit (still guesses, overridable in Settings).
- Which service UUID other firmware versions expose (the station above was found with the widened candidate list).
- How Chrome's MTU interacts with other stations.

## Known Web Bluetooth limitations

- No Safari or Firefox support. On iOS only third-party browsers such as Bluefy work.
- Pages need HTTPS or localhost, and the device chooser must be opened by a user gesture. Auto-reconnect only works while the tab is open; a page reload means choosing the device again.
- Only services listed in `optionalServices` are visible (see above).
- One central at a time: close the official app before connecting.
- Background tabs may be throttled, so energy counters do not bridge gaps longer than 10 s.
- The Wi-Fi password travels **in plain text** over BLE, because the device protocol has no encryption. The UI warns about this and masks it in the frame log.
